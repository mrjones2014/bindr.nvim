# Contributing

## Setting Up

To contribute, you will need to install the [Teal compiler](https://github.com/teal-language/tl).

```sh
luarocks install tl
```

Then, run `make init` which will set up a pre-commit git hook to automatically recompile the Teal code
into Lua when you make a commit.

## Code Style

When contributing to `legendary.nvim`, please make sure your code passes all checks.
If you have [Stylua](https://github.com/johnnymorganz/stylua) and [Luacheck](https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck)
installed, you can run the checks locally by running `make check`. This will run the linter, the style checker,
and all unit tests. Make sure to follow the code style found in the existing code.
